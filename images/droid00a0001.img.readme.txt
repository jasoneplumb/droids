DROID00A0001.IMG

The above file is a boot image for the generic droid development platform (00A).

Additional specific boot images will be enumerated with base-16 (e.g. 00B, ..., 0C9), 
followed by a base-10 release sequence number (e.g., 0001, 0002, ...).

To use this image, you will need to complete the following configurations.

A. Image a Micro SD Card as a boot image to use in the next step:

1. If needed, save the contents of a Micro SD Card (8+GB) since 
it will be overwritten in the next step.
2. Download a boot image tool (e.g., https://etcher.download) 
and use it to image the Micro SD Card with the .IMG file named at the top of this file.
Note: The card is now ready to use in the next step (B). 
If you try to mount it, you will be propted to reformat. If you do this, just repeat step 2.

B. Configure the Raspberry Pi to attach to your network:

1. Attach HDMI cable and display.
2. Attach USB keyboard.
3. Attach USB mouse.
4. Plug in the SD Card that was imaged in the prior step (A).
5. Plug in the Pi to power it on (e.g, 5V microusb cable and power adapter) and wait for the system to boot.
6. Run 'sudo raspi-config' from the terminal.
7. Go into System Options > Wireless LAN.
8. Type your SSID and your password.
9. Exit the tool. After a few seconds, your Pi will attach to the network.

C. Determine the IP address so that you can attach remotely using another system on the same network:

1. Determine the IP address of the device (e.g., >ifconfig). 
Note: The IP address will be used to connect to the device using the VNC application in a later step.
2. Optionally disconnect the HDMI cable/display.
3. Optionally disconnect the USB keyboard.
4. Optionally disconnect the USB mouse.
5. Install/Start VNC on another machine and initiate the connection using the IP address on port 1 
(e.g., Enter the IP address followed by ':1' similar to '1.192.168.40:1')

At this point, you are ready to stage sensors, and add a startup script to read/upload sensor data. Woot!
